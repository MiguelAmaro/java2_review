# Java Review

This purpose of this repo is to have a minimalistic project to play with the java features and the behaviors they produce.


## Things to review
- [ ] Multible in heritance via Interfaces
- [ ] Calling super class constructors/methods from child classes
- [ ] Abstract classes
- [ ] Overiding vs Overloading
- [ ] reading/writing files, file class usage
- [ ] exception handling, try/catch
- [ ] inner class
- [ ] static classes (inner, ect..)

## Creating a package
```batch
rem build.bat
rem NOTE:
rem provide the path to the examples class files so the compiler can resolve the 
rem import statement `import com.examples.*;` in the main java
rem PROJ_DIR\build -> \com\expamles\*.class
```

## ExFiles

	* FileReader FileWriter
	* PrintWriter
